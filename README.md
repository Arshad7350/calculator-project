## 💡 How It Works

- The calculator is made using an HTML `<form>` with input buttons.
- Each button uses `onclick` inline JavaScript to manipulate the display.
- The `eval()` function is used to calculate the result when `=` is clicked.

Example:
```html
<input type="button" value="=" onclick="display.value = eval(display.value)" class="equal operator">
